# Saliency-Prediction

Saliency detection is a fundamental topic in computer vision. It can to solve
problems like face detection, object detection, object discovery which can have
numerous applications in daily life like in mobile phones camera software to
traffic cameras. The main task of the project was to build a model, prepare
data sets, train the model and predict the salient regions of the original images.
The final salient image predictions are generated as a gray scale image. For this
saliency system was developed using deep neural network architecture utilizing
the encoder-decoder structure. The model, data set preparation and training
was done using Pytorch library and python being the programming language.

Some of the sample predictions by the trained model of key areas of the image are shown below:
